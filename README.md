# OpenGL-Convex-Polygons
In this study, we refer to the the mathematical theory behind convex polygons, the general
procedure for constructing them using a given primitive triangle algorithm, and describe
the process of visualizing them in a computational environment with only mathematical operations. Initially, we present the mathematical foundations concerning convex polygons,
including their properties, angles, and edges. We then examine the fundamental mathematical operations related to convex polygons, such as computing their area and convex
hull, as well as calculating the linear functions of their edges for all pixel elements within
their bounding boxes. In the second part of the study, we focus on the visualization of
arbitrary convex polygons in a computational environment using OpenGL. Additionally,
we provide code examples and implement algorithms for rasterization and area analysis.
Finally, we present the results of the tests conducted to evaluate the performance of the
proposed system. We assess the speed and accuracy of the computations in various scenarios and polygon sizes. The results demonstrate that the system provides efficient and
accurate visualization of convex polygons using the OpenGL library.
